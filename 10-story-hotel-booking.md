## Introduction

Imagine you are the owner of a portuguese hotel. You notice that some of the reservations are cancelled on a regular basis. To maximize revenue you plan to practice room overbooking strategy. How exactly would you approach this strategy? How many rooms to oversell? Which customers are most likely to cancel their reservation? What is the probability of cancellation? And most importantly: **what is the reason behind the prediction?** We will make an attempt to answer this question using explainable machine learning.

From the standpoint of a machine learning engineer one might want to find a model that not only is high-performing, but is also based on intuitive insights about the data. In the case of several competing

A persuasive manager of the facility might want to attempt to offer the booking on slightly different conditions to customers that are most prone to cancel their reservation e.g. by offering a non-refundable booking for customers from Portugal and Germany. It will be of crucial importance to determine which features to tweak to make the booking as secure as possible while trying not to make the customer feel too uncomfortable by insisting on too many changes. To solve this interesting problem we propose instance-specific explainable machine learning techniques.

## Model comparison

Here we will provide various models with their respective accuracy scores and our comments on the intuitiveness of explanations behind those predictions.

## Offering different conditions

Here we will attempt to use a instance-specific explainable machine learning techniques in order to provide a similar offer that will reduce the probability of cancellation.
We will determine which methods, if any, might be applicable for real-time negotiation.

## Final remarks

Here we will summarize our findings and conclude the chapter.
